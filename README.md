## Main features:
- **Add Notes:** The user can add a new note with a title and content.
- **Edit notes:** Existing notes can be edited.
- **Deleting notes:** The user can delete a note from the database.
- **View notes:** All notes are displayed in a list.
- **Authorization:** Access to the application is provided through the Spring Security authorization mechanism using the database.
